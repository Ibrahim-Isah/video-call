# Snaphunt Interview Video Call

The Video call app works by a user creating a room and sharing the room name for other users to join the call. The call can also be recorded by clicking on the settings button when the call has started and switch to the Recording Tab. The Recording is currently not working on the hosted version as the S3 Bucket were not provided. But you can install locally and add S3 credentials to test the recording.
